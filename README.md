# alx-backend-python

Welcome to the backend Python project! This readme file will provide you with all the necessary information to set up and run the backend Python code.

## Project Description

This project is a backend application written in Python that serves as the server-side component for a web or mobile application. It provides various functionalities such as handling requests, processing data, interacting with databases, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend Python code, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mondlivundla/repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory: 
   ```
   cd project-directory
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies: 
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

Before running the backend code, you may need to configure certain settings. Look for a configuration file, such as `config.py` or `settings.py`, and update the necessary values, such as database credentials or API keys.

### Running the Application

To run the backend application, execute the following command:

```
python app.py
```

This command will start the server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running.

### API Documentation

If this backend project provides an API, make sure to include API documentation in a separate file or directory. This documentation should describe the available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and any other relevant information.

### Testing

To run the tests for the backend code, use the following command:

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

This command will discover and execute all the test cases in the `tests` directory.
